# Compare results with Table 6 of IAPWS (2016), "Revised Release
# on the IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties
# of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use".
# This document is available from the iapws.org web site as
# document IAPWS R6-95 (IAPWS95-2016.pdf). The purpose is to
# validate the calculation of the phi functions, for 500K and
# a density of 838.0250 kg/m3. Running the software with
# with "showphi" causes the phi functions to be written on the
# output. Density must be specified in kg/m3, not g/cm3.

# The contents of Table 6 from IAPWS (2016) partially duplicate
# Table 6.6 of Wagner and Pruss (2002). The latter table also
# includes a test at 647K and density of 358 kg/m3. Our results
# for phir, phird, and phirdd not precisely match theirs for
# these conditions. We believe it likely that IAPWS (2016)
# dropped this part of the original test for a reason, though
# they do not give one. This close to the critical point, minor
# differences may result from differences in  numerical methods
# and tolerances. Results may also be compared with results
# (for liquid) from Table 13.1 of Wagner and Pruss (2002).
# However, their results are given to less precision.

# For the case at 500K and density of 838.0250 kg/m3, the result
# for phi0 given by Wagner and Pruss (2002) is off by one in the
# last decimal place from the value given by IAPWS (2016).

# The following strings are write option switches.
