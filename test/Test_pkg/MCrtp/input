# MCrtp

# Calculate results for 298.15K and 1 bar pressure,
# specifying different starting values for the density
# (rhog, kg/m3). The purpose is to examine convergence
# behavior and to check for multiple solutions.
# Here two solutions are found, one of which is the
# expected solution for liquid water. The other
# solution can be interpreted as representing metastable
# vapor, although this is technically an extrapolation
# and may not be accurate.

# The following strings are write option switches.
