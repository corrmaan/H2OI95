# Calculate results for 298.15K and 1 bar pressure.
# The purpose is to validate the thermochemical results
# against the CODATA (Cox et al., 1989) recommendations
# for the thermochemical properties of water. For
# illustrative purposes, results are also obtained for
# 1 atm pressure (1.01325 bar). Pressure must be
# specified in MPa, not bars.

# The following strings are write option switches.
