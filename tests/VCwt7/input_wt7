# Compare results with Table 7 of IAPWS (2016), "Revised Release
# on the IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties
# of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use".
# This document is available from the iapws.org web site as
# document IAPWS R6-95 (IAPWS95-2016.pdf). The purpose is to
# validate results obtained for specified temperature and density
# values. Density must be specified in kg/m3.

# Results for 647K and density of 358 kg/m3 do not precisely
# match those given by IAPWS (2016). This close to the critical
# point, minor differences may result from differences in
# numerical methods and tolerances. Results may also be compared
# with results (for liquid) from Table 13.1 of Wagner and Pruss
# (2002). However, their results are given to less precision.

# The following strings are write option switches.
