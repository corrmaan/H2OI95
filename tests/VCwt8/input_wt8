# Compare results with Table 8 of IAPWS (2016), "Revised Release
# on the IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties
# of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use".
# This document is available from the iapws.org web site as
# document IAPWS R6-95 (IAPWS95-2016.pdf). The purpose is to
# validate results obtained for specified temperature and density
# values. Here the "psat" option is used to calculate vapor and
# liquid properties on the saturation curve.

# Our results do not precisely agree with those of IAPWS
# (2016) for 625K. These differences may be a consequence of
# using different numerical methods and tolerances, the effect
# of which is probably greater near the critical point.
